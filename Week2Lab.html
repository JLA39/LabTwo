<h1>Keeping You Up to Date</h1>
<p>
    I just got a purebred pug puppy - his name is Cooper! I believe that
    he is about 5 months old. I have taught him a couple of tricks,
    such as "lay down" and "sit". Although he catches on very quickly,
    I am having difficulty training him to give me his paw. I am the
    only person to ever have trained him, and for that, I am proud.
